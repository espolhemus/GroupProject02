# Group Project #2 - BookMaster
Contributors: David Santiago, Nainoa Dinson, Austin Oler and Erin Polhemus 

## Description

Group Project #2 involved the creation of a real-world full-stack application that meets the following criteria:

- Use Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API.
- Use Handlebars.js as the templating engine.
- Use MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database.
- Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.
- Be deployed using Heroku (with data).
- Use at least one new library, package, or technology that we havenâ€™t discussed (which, in our case, is Tailwind)
- Have a polished UI.
- Be responsive.
- Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
- Have a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm.
- Include authentication (express-session and cookies).
- Protect API keys and sensitive information with environment variables.
- Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).
- Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
    
Our group elected to develop an application (which we refer to as "BookMaster") that helps the user to manage and currate their reading list, by allowing the user search the Google Books API by title, author, or by ISBN number, and to then browse through the results, viewing specific attributes of each title, and to identify books that they have already ready as well as those they would like to read, to assign a rating to those titles they have already read, and to browse and read a selection of free electronic books.
